1. Objectives

	This REA (Open Educational Resource) consist of an Input/Output simulator of an Operating System. It simulates the three most utilized methods: Programmed I/O, Interrupt-Driven and Direct Memory Access (DMA). Its aim is to show structural and functional aspects of each technic, in addition to necessary concepts to completely understand it. Hence, it is important to the student to pay attention to each process step modification.

2. System requirements

	During the preparation of this educational resource, we thought in what would be the best way to produce it, either to the implementation of the resource as for distribution, requirements and installation. It was decided to do it for WEB, thus the implementation would not be so complicated considering packages such as jQuery that assist in the animations, and for the distribution and installation is only required to pass the link of the page where the REA is hosted. The unique requirement is the browser. Windows comes with Internet Explorer, Linux with Mozilla Firefox, and Mac with Safari, so there is no difficulty in this point.

3. Teaching with the REA

	The REA for Input/Output methods was developed with focus on education. Therefore, its menu is interactive and consists of an overview of the method and a step-by-step view.
The overview is made possible by the Start button that runs the method completely at once, fluidly, lively and explanatorily.
The step-by-step view takes place with the aid of the < and > buttons, which can pass the operation of the program one step at a time. Thus, after the students have an overview of the method, they can analyze it in detail pausing every step. The explanatory text below the simulation not only helps students but also the professor.
